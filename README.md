#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Is a discipline focused on the systematic development of high-quality software products using engineering principles, methods, and tools.
Importance
1. Software engineering helps develop solutions that can quickly analyze and manage large amounts of data resulting in an increased operational capacity of a financial institution.
2. In the healthcare industry, software engineering makes it possible to develop applications that streamline patient records, provide faster access to information, and automate routine processes.
3. In the entertainment industry, software engineering has enabled software engineers to create immersive and interactive experiences for users worldwide from streaming services to video games


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Development of programming languages like Fortran in the 1960s abstracted much of the complexity of low-level programming, making it easier for developers to write software
2. The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s. As computers became more complex, the need for specialized software development became apparent. This led to the birth of software engineering as a distinct discpline.
3. The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s. Many software development projects were taking too much long to complete and as a resuult industry leaders reealized they needed to find a new way to manage software deevelopment.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements- Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design- Creating high-level detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
Implementation- Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
Testing- Conducting various tests to ensure the softawre meets the quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment- Releasing the software to users.
Maintenace- Providing ongoing support, updates and enhancements to the softawre after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is a sequential and rigid while Agile is flexible and iterative.
Scenarios: Waterfall- When thorough planning and execution in predetermined stages is required
Agile- When emphasizing contionus feedback and adoption.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer- Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
Quality Assurance  Engineer- Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager- Oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software system

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Is a software application that helps programmers develop software code effectively. It also increases developer productivity by combining capabilities such as software editing, building, testing and packing in an easy-to-use application.
Examples of IDEs Source - coder, Compiler, debbuger
Version Control System efficiently manages and tracks changes to code over time, facilitating team collaboration and project progress tracking. Examples Git and Github

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Tight deadlines- Prioritize tasks
2. Changing requirements- Adopt an agile approach/ methodology such as scrum

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing- Testing individual components of a software. Importance: Ensures that each unit of the software performs as intended and meets requirements.
Integration testing- Testing interaction between different components. Importance: Helps to identify and resolve any issues that may arise when components are combined.
System testing- Testing the entire system as a whole. Importance: Offers visibility into the stability of a product at every stage of development.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. 
Importance- Prompt Engineering makes it easy for users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Example: 'Tell me about dogs'
Specific Prompt: ' Tell me about the history of wild dogs in Africa'
The improved prompt is effective because it is specific, clear and concise.
